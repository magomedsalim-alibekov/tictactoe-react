This is React game Tic-Tac-Toe from React docs. Nothing amazing things.

Note: Need to download Node.js. If you have Node.js yet, download it in official site: [[https://nodejs.org/]]

But it doesn't run in website. You need to download all files, upload it in any directory and open there terminal.
When you open terminal, you need to see, thats your choose the path to downloaded files.

It should be like this: ``C:/Users/path/to/project``

After that, write in terminal: ``npm install''. This will download all dependencies for working the game.

After installing you need to start the game. In terminal write: ``npm start''. That would be start the game and you wiil see that site just opened right now in your browser.
If it's doesn't opened automatickly, in terminal you will see your localhost or something like this:

"You can now view react.dev in the browser.

  Local:            http://{your localhost}
  On Your Network:  http://{your own network}

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build."

Just click to the link in localhost (CMD/CTRL + Left mouse button) to open it

And it's done! You can play tic-tac-toe game! Hope i not mislead you.:)
